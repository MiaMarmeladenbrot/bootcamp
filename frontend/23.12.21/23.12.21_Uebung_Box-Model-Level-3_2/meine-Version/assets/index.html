      <h2>Decorating with plants is simple</h2>
      <p>
        To create the most interesting display, use a mixture of plant sizes and
        leaf shapes. A large plant like Pippa the peace lily, mixed with
        something sculptural like Susie the snake plant and a soft fern like
        Bertie gives an attractive range of textures. Hanging plants, like
        Rapunzel the golden pothos, add interest at different heights. Don’t
        forget your pots. Matching pots will look clean and elegant, while a mix
        of styles and patterns looks eclectic and fun.
